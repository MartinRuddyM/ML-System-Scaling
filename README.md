## ML System Scaling

##### A project about testing scaling strategies for ML systems

The goal of this project is to test different ML scaling strategies for a system under heavy data flows with varying demand. This project is for the course [Advanced Topics in Software Systems](https://github.com/rdsea/sys4bigml) at Aalto University (fall 2024 edition).

## Introduction
  
In modern software systems, it’s important to design them in a way that they can handle different challenges effectively. This is where the concept of R3E comes in, which stands for Robustness, Resilience, Reliability, and Elasticity. These four factors help measure how well a system can perform under pressure, adapt to changes, and recover from issues. Among these, Elasticity is especially important when systems need to scale up or down depending on demand.

Elasticity is all about how systems use resources efficiently. For example, when there’s a spike in users or data, the system should quickly handle the extra load. At the same time, when demand drops, the system should scale down to save resources. This ability makes sure systems remain cost-effective while still performing well for users.
  
This project explores Elasticity by testing how systems can scale using different techniques. By comparing these approaches, we can gain a better understanding of what works best for creating systems that are flexible, reliable, and efficient in dynamic environments.
